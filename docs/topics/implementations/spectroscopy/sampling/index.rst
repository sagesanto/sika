Samplers and Models
===================
Pre-defined samplers and models for single and n-component modeling.


:ref:`Grid Companion Model <grid_companion>`

A grid-based model for a brown dwarf drawn from a grid of spectra.

:ref:`Composite Binary Model <composite_binary>`
------------------------------------------------
A model for a binary system of two brown dwarfs, combined according to their K-band flux.
