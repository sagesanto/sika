# sika
A spectroscopy-focused framework for building modeling pipelines that are modular, reproducible, and scalable.

Key features:
   - Reusable components enable easy end-to-end testing and iteration of pipelines
   - Configuration-powered pipeline steps allow for flexible, reproducible workflows   
   - Pipeline runs generate and save self-documentation from code and configuration at runtime, increasing reproducibility
   - Provides built-in tools for visualizing and communicating pipeline architecture
   - Capable of robust, convenient multidimensional parameter fitting
   - Supports file-caching, parallelization and other features that allow pipelines to be applied to large, compute intensive tasks 

# WIP
sika documentation is largely complete but more guides are being written. This will be updated when the docs are hsoted online - right now those brave enough can be build them in their immature form from the docs folder of this repository.

Scripts demonstrating the use of sika are also forthcoming.
